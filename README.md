# Brainhack Local Template

This template provides you with a simple structure for your Brainhack website. It is made using Cookiecutter, that helps you filling some information about the website.

Install it:
```
https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
```

And use our template by running:
```
cookiecutter gh:brainhackorg/local_brainhack
```

It will ask you for information that will be filled during the setup.

The filled information will give a kick-off for your brand new Brainhack website, but you must do some changes in the `index.html` file for it to be ready to publish:
1) Make sure to update the dates of your local Brainhack, together with your schedule information. The provided schedule table specifies what is the format for this information. Also, specify the timezone of your event, allowing people from other timezones to join your Brainhack;
2) You can add more information to the Information section, if required. However, please make sure to keep the Code of Conduct link, so everyone participating is aware of it;
3) Update the Projects section, ensuring that all participants have access to the projects that are intented to be worked on during the Brainhack;
4) Get in touch: update your contact information, adding the channels that will be used during Brainhack. Also update the organizers list;
5) Add the institutions that are supporting this local Brainhack
